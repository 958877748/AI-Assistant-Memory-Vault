Encountered 'Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v3' when creating a GitHub workflow to generate a file with repomix. The root cause was using a deprecated version of the upload-artifact action. The solution involved upgrading to 'actions/upload-artifact@v4'. Key steps for similar future tasks: 1. Always check for deprecated actions and use the latest versions. 2. Verify that the file content to be updated and the SHA submitted are consistent with the *desired* new content. 3. Retry the workflow after making changes. This update increases the chance of successfully creating similar workflows on the first attempt.
